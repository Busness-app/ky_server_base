# Restoring a Busnes.app server from a capsule

This is the procedure for bringing a server built on this scaffold back from a `.kycap`
backup after the original is gone. It needs three things, held by three different parties by
design:

| Thing | Who has it |
|---|---|
| The capsule (`.kycap`) | KyRecovery, or the local backup directory, or a downloaded copy |
| k custodian cards | The custodians from the suite ceremony (k is usually 2 of 3) |
| A machine to restore on | You |

Nobody can do this alone. KyRecovery cannot open a capsule. One custodian cannot. The server
that made the backup never could. That is the point, and it is also why you should run this
procedure once as a drill before you ever need it.

## What a capsule holds

Everything a fresh server needs to be the old one:

| Path in the capsule | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/ky_server.db` | The whole database: users, sessions, MFA state, devices, SCIM groups, audit log, settings, the sealed KyRecovery token |
| `data/encryption.key` | 32 bytes. Every TOTP secret and the KyRecovery pairing token are encrypted under it |
| `data/recovery.pub` | The suite recovery public key, so the restored server comes back pinned (present when the backup had a key) |
| `config/settings.json` | App name, URL, port, database driver. For your reference when re-deploying; nothing reads it |

The restored directory is the live directory in the clear. Treat it like the running server's
`data/`.

## Before you start

- **Pick the capsule.** In the KyRecovery dashboard, open Capsules, find the newest one for
  this service (the app name, `Busnes.app` unless `KY_APP_NAME` was set) that is not flagged
  corrupt, and note its `capsule_id`, `created_at` and `digest`. You will compare these after
  the restore. From a local backup directory the file is `<escaped app name>.<capsule-id>.kycap`
  (`Busnes_2eapp.cap-Busnes.app-<n>.kycap` by default); the newest is the one to use unless
  you have a reason.
- **Gather k custodians.** Each card carries one share, a single line beginning `ky2-`. They
  type or paste it themselves; do not collect the shares in a file, a chat, or an email. Two
  shares in one place is the suite key in one place.
- **Prepare an empty directory** on a machine you trust, ideally the one that will run the
  restored server. The restore refuses a directory that is not empty.

## Step 1: open the capsule

With the binary (from a release, or `go build ./cmd/server`):

```bash
ky_server_base restore -capsule Busnes_2eapp.cap-XXXXXXXX.kycap -to ./restored
```

`-service` defaults to `KY_APP_NAME`, then `Busnes.app`. Pass it only when the backup was made
under a different app name; the capsule's service name must match or the restore stops before
reading a share.

With Docker Compose, from the repository directory, mount the capsule and an empty target
directory into a one-off container. Create the target yourself at mode 700 and run the
container as your own user, so what comes out is owned by you and not by root. The image's
entrypoint is the binary, so the subcommand goes straight after the service name; `--no-deps`
keeps the real server down:

```bash
mkdir -m 700 restored
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$PWD/Busnes_2eapp.cap-XXXXXXXX.kycap:/in.kycap:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/restored:/restored" \
  app restore -capsule /in.kycap -to /restored
```

The bare binary needs none of this: it creates a missing target itself at mode 700.

The command prompts:

```
Paste custodian shares, one per line, then Ctrl-D:
```

Each custodian enters their share on its own line. After the k-th, press Ctrl-D. Shares are
read from stdin only, never from the command line, because argv is world-readable and lands
in shell history.

Only for a rehearsal with synthetic test shares, never with real cards, stdin can be a file.
Delete it afterwards; a file holding k shares is the suite key in a file.

On success it prints the authenticated manifest:

```
Restored 4 files from capsule cap-Busnes.app-1788605720094118543
  service:      Busnes.app (v1.0.0)
  created:      2026-09-05T12:15:20Z
  recovery key: 886ff52c...
  payload hash: 8a053985...
```

**Check it against KyRecovery's record.** The capsule ID and `created` must match the
deposit record you noted. Opening has already proved the bytes are intact and were sealed to
the suite key; matching the ID and time against the blind store's record is what proves this
is the capsule you meant, not an older one someone substituted.

Failures you may see, and what they mean:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `capsule is for service "Busnes.app", this instance is "X"` | `-service` or `KY_APP_NAME` names something else. Override `-service` only if the backup was made under a different app name |
| `shamir: fewer shares than the threshold requires` | Fewer than k valid lines were read. Check for a missed line or a truncated paste |
| `restore target directory is not empty` | Use an empty directory. The restore never overwrites |
| a decrypt or integrity error | Wrong shares (from a different ceremony), a share mistyped, or a damaged file. Re-download and retry with the custodians |

## Step 2: check what came out

```bash
find restored -type f -printf '%m %p\n'
```

Expect three or four files, all mode `600`, under `restored/data` and `restored/config`.
`cat restored/config/settings.json` shows the app URL and port the old server ran with.

## Step 3: put it in service

**Docker Compose (the normal deployment).** The data directory is the bind mount `./data`
in the compose project. It must be empty before the copy, for the same reason Step 1 demands
an empty directory: a capsule carries `ky_server.db` but never its `-wal` and `-shm`
sidecars, and a write-ahead log left over from the old database would be replayed into the
restored one at first open, mixing two databases.

```bash
docker compose down
ls -A data | wc -l
```

That must print `0`. If it does not, the old directory still holds data, and you keep a copy
of it before anything else: it holds every change made after the capsule was sealed, and it
is the only record Step 5 can walk. The container runs as root, so the files are root-owned;
copy as root into a directory you create at mode 700:

```bash
mkdir -m 700 old-data
sudo cp -a data/. old-data/ && sudo ls -A old-data | wc -l
```

The count must equal the count above and the command must exit 0. `old-data/` is now the
old live directory in the clear, with the same key the capsule holds; it is removed in
"Afterwards", not before Step 5 is done.

Only with the copy confirmed, empty the directory. This is irreversible:

```bash
sudo rm -rf data/* data/.[!.]*
ls -A data | wc -l
```

With `0` confirmed, copy the restored files in and start:

```bash
sudo cp -a restored/data/. data/ && sudo chmod 600 data/*
docker compose up -d
```

Keep `KY_APP_URL` and `KY_APP_NAME` identical to the old deployment, from
`config/settings.json`: the app name is what every capsule is sealed under and what
KyRecovery pinned for the pairing token.

The restored `encryption.key` is the key; the file form is the one to use. If the old
deployment supplied `KY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` by environment instead, the environment wins when
both are present, so either remove that variable so the file is read, or keep supplying the
same value from wherever the old deployment kept it. Never print a key to a terminal or type
one on a command line: it lands in scrollback, session recordings and shell history. If you
must produce the hex form, write it straight into the compose project's `.env` with
`umask 077` and nothing else on stdout.

**Bare binary.** Point `KY_DATA_DIR` at `restored/data`, set `KY_APP_URL` and `KY_APP_NAME`
as before, and start.

## Step 4: prove it

1. Open the app URL and sign in with an existing admin account and its second factor. TOTP
   working proves `encryption.key` is right.
2. Open Backup & recovery. If the backup had a key, the recovery key shows as pinned with the
   same key ID as before; compare it with the ceremony card. If the backup was paired, the
   sealed token came across in the database, so the restored server can deposit again
   without re-pairing: click Back up now to prove it. If the screen says the key is missing,
   `data/recovery.pub` did not come across; re-pair, which is refused unless KyRecovery hands
   back the same key.
3. Check the audit log: the last events before the restore are there, followed by your
   sign-in.

## Step 5: decide what to trust

The restore proves the service works. It does not make the restored state current or safe.
Everything comes back as of the capsule's `created_at`: users, passwords, MFA enrolments,
paired devices, SCIM state, sessions. Anything you revoked or changed after that moment is
undone, and a session cookie minted before the capsule still validates against the restored
server, because sessions are database rows and the capsule brought them back.

1. Revoke sessions. There is no per-user control in the UI and no global revoke; sessions
   are rows in the `sessions` table. Delete them all, once, before anyone signs in:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   sudo sqlite3 data/ky_server.db 'DELETE FROM sessions;'
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Everyone signs in again. After hardware loss that is enough.
2. Walk the old audit log in `old-data/ky_server.db` from `created_at` to the moment the old
   server was lost (the restored server's log stops at `created_at`), and re-apply what
   happened after the capsule: disabled accounts, rotated passwords, removed devices, reset
   MFA, SCIM changes.
3. If the reason for the restore was a suspected compromise rather than hardware loss, treat
   the restored secrets as exposed and rotate the ones that can be rotated. A restore from
   before a compromise brings the attacker's access back with the service unless you do this.

   **Never rotate `encryption.key`.** Every TOTP secret and the KyRecovery pairing token are
   encrypted under it. Remove it and every user's second factor and the pairing are gone for
   good, on a server you just recovered.

   What can be rotated, and how:

   - `KY_SESSION_SECRET` signs the proof-of-work login challenge, nothing durable. Replace it
     with `openssl rand -hex 32` written straight into `.env`, not echoed, then
     `docker compose up -d`.
   - `KY_SCIM_TOKEN` is the SCIM bearer. Replace it the same way and give the new value to the
     identity provider. If it was never set, the server mints a fresh one at every start.
   - The KyRecovery pairing token: ask the KyRecovery admin to revoke this service and pair
     again from the screen; the same key comes back, so the pairing is accepted.

   Then have every admin re-enrol their second factor, and confirm with a Back up now so the
   recovered server has a capsule that reflects the rotation.

## Afterwards

- Delete the `restored/` directory once the server runs from its own copy, and `old-data/`
  once Step 5 is done. Both are the live directory in the clear, key included. Files in
  `old-data/` are root-owned after the copy, so `sudo rm -rf old-data`.
- The custodians' cards are unchanged; a restore does not consume them. If a card was
  exposed during the restore (read aloud, photographed, pasted anywhere shared), that is a
  key compromise for the whole suite, not for one server: run a new ceremony.
- Make a backup from the restored server so the newest capsule reflects the recovery.

## Drill it

Run Steps 1 and 2 against the latest capsule on a scratch machine once a quarter, with the
real custodians and their real cards, and then delete the output. The in-app drill proves the
capsule format restores; only this proves the cards do.

The in-app drill and `backup-drill` CLI validate the recipe from the capsule actually opened,
including required files, read-only SQLite integrity and environment-variable presence.
A malformed recipe fails the drill. Concurrent drills on one data directory are refused
(HTTP 409 or a CLI error); retry after the active drill finishes. The OS releases the lock
if the process exits. Keep `data/drill.lock` in place; it holds no secret and must not be
removed to bypass a running drill. Opened scratch data stays under `data/drill` with 0700
permissions and is removed when the drill returns.
