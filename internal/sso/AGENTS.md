# SSO

## Purpose
Provides unified Single Sign-On federation for KySignOn, Generic OpenID Connect (Google, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak), and SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP).

## Ownership
Owns the application adapters around OAuth/OIDC login, KySignOn HMAC-SHA256 signed directory sync webhooks, and SAML metadata publication.

## Local Contracts
- `KySignOnClient.HandleSyncWebhook` verifies HMAC-SHA256 signatures before modifying local user state.
- PKCE with `S256` is enforced on all OAuth/OIDC authorization requests.
- ID tokens require provider signature, issuer, audience, expiry, and one-time nonce verification before claims are trusted.
- OAuth discovery, authorization URLs, PKCE parameters, code exchange, and token verification are delegated to `golang.org/x/oauth2` and `coreos/go-oidc`; application code only maps verified claims.
- SAML assertion parsing is not implemented locally; metadata XML uses `encoding/xml` and no ACS route is exposed until a maintained SAML service-provider library is configured.
- Directory webhook timestamps are accepted only within five minutes; status or role changes revoke the user's sessions.

## Verification
- `go test -v ./internal/sso/...`

## Child DOX Index
None.
